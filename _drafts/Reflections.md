I enjoy creation as instantiated learning. It is the intersection of knowledge with competence. 

Creation has both external and internal aspects. Externally, it is proof of competence, a journeyman’s masterwork. Internally it can serve the same function, but it is also the mechanism by which we learn and make progress. Practice makes perfect. 

There are potentially two types of creation: practice and product. It is not always important to know which you are engaging in a priori. In many situations, you can simply practice until the result is satisfactory. But if you are constrained by resources or time, or if you are accountable to someone else, it is essential to know what sort of creation you are embarking on. 

My personal utility function for creation is a shifted sigmoid function of my current skill. My satisfaction from practice increases rapidly while I am a novice and improving, then plateaus asymptotically once I have achieved a level of expertise. This level is usually unknown at the outset, or rather it evolves over time as practice reveals the depth of my deficiency. 

Learning as the acquisition of knowledge vs the development of competence, a process of internalizing external information. Discovery -> Comprehension-> Familiarity ->understanding . Formal information theory. Aside: is certain information naturally self replicating on our substrate?

Not all learning requires or implies creation. Creation is the application of work to reduce local entropy. In order for learning to be “creative”, the information being learned must represent a hypothetical state of reality with lower entropy than currently exists. 

Very interesting scenarios when information is emergent from the combination of the learner’s prior state and the acquisition of new knowledge. This is what we would typically call discovery.

Without qualification, creation encompasses rote repetition: the potter at the wheel producing endless copies of the same mug. I enjoy the creative act as the culmination of a learning process, having first understood something new.
