![Google's strength is underrated](http://richardbenjaminrush.com/images/clash-of-the-titans.png)

- Power of training your users multiplied in a voice-only context
- Decision not to name GA makes sense given roots in voice search
- Handicapped by "google" as a verb
- 400M+ devices running Assistant vs >25M Alexa
- 50M+ chromecasts , <10M Google Home
- Value of a smart speaker is omnipresence, always on. Don't have to reach into pocket.
- Killer feature on Alexa: voice purchase (in that it's something Google can't do as well)
- Killer features of Google Assistant:
    - multi-device: same service follows you throughout your day
    - Chromecast is 1000x better UX than Fire TV
    - Access to *all* your data.
    - Vastly superior search.
    - Vast Android App ecosystem
- Monetize voice search by throwing between devices: open on mobile counts as a click
