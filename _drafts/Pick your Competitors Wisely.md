At Pioneer Square Labs, we spend a lot of time looking for interesting opportunities to build companies. Over the years, we’ve found that while there are few hard and fast roles, there are some useful tricks we can use to identify potential areas of interest. One of my favorites is to pick your competitor. 

This one works more or less as you’d imagine: start by looking for a company whose lunch you want to eat. It doesn’t have to be the proverbial “biggest guy in the yard,” but they do have to be big— big enough that if you win the outcome was worth the fight. 

I’m particularly fond of the “despised vendor” approach to this strategy: look for an industry where a class of vendors are widely hated. When you find one, it’s virtually certain that these incumbents have created very substantial leverage over their customers; if they hadn’t, they would have been forced to change their ways. The trick is figuring out your way in. 

More often than not, these vendor conflicts stem from misaligned business models. For example, there are a shocking number of companies that persist in a flat per-seat license model without ever considering alternatives. Some of these businesses are vulnerable to business model disruption. 

Advantage: you’re selling a solution your customers already know they need and know how to buy. Stewart Butterfield blog post. 

Situations where the vendor undervalues the “commodity” business relative to the customer.
