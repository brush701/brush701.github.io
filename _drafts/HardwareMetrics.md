Key concerns for hardware companies: 

* Capital requirements
* Margins

Everything else is just a driver for these questions. Hardware businesses often require large amounts of capital for two purposes: cap ex and working capital. One of the most significant metrics for understanding the working capital needs of the business is the Cash Conversion Cycle, which is the number of days it takes the company to convert investments in inventory into revenue.

~~~
CCC = DSI + DSO - DPO. 
DSI = Days sales in inventory
DSO = Days sales outstanding
DPO = Days payable outstanding
~~~

Simply put this relationship says that a company can shorten its cash conversion cycle by holding less inventory, paying its suppliers more slowly, and collecting from customers more quickly. 

The key driver for increased working capital is the (potential) requirement to hold inventory. There are several important metrics here, the first of which is Days Sales in Inventory. DSI = Average Inventory Balance/COGS. We want a low DSI value, which we can achieve by reducing our inventory levels. Assuming an optimal inventory policy, the average inventory balance is directly proportional to demand, lead times from suppliers, and desired service level. Each of these variables are the focus of questions below. 

The other important link between inventory and working capital is Days Payable Outstanding, given by Average Accounts Payable/COGS. Here we can directly increase this metric (and thereby reduce CCC) by negotiating more favorable payment terms with suppliers. Many vendors will require prepayment or COD (cash on delivery) for young companies, but many will be willing to offer more favorable terms (ie net-20 or net-30) once a track record has been established. 

Supply chain complexity/management -> Team, experience, modern best practices. Intl?

Key questions to ask:

Capital Requirements:

* Are you manufacturing in house or outsourcing? 
    * If in-house, there had better be a very good reason _and_ a plan to keep the required equity investments in line with business milestones/de-risking. Alternative forms of financing, including venture debt, may be appropriate to fund CapEx.
    * If outsourcing, then you need to understand both MOQ and manufacturer's margin. MOQ is much more important in the short term; margin is more important long-term.
* Assuming you outsource manufacturing, can your provider drop-ship for you?
    * If yes, what will they charge you for the convenience? 
* If you must hold inventory:
    * What is the lead time on inventory from suppliers? Here, we really care about the longest-lead component.
    * How can you manage demand to keep it in line with your ability to fulfill orders?
    * Are your customers willing to pre-order or tolerate long wait times before receiving the product? 
    * What payment terms will you receive from suppliers? How will this change over time?
    
Margins:

* What gross margin can you expect on day one? How will this change once you are at scale?
* Are there other significant variable costs associated with selling your product that are not part of COGS (ie. commissions, etc)?
* Can you expect significant volume discounts?
* How will you handle distribution/fulfillment? How does this scale? 

There are certainly many other significant questions, but these are the primary considerations unique to hardware companies.
