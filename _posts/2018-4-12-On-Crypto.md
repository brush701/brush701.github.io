title: On Crypto
---

Unless you've been hiding under a rock for the past year, you're at least peripherally aware of the insane hype around cryptocurrencies. As of this writing Bitcoin is at $6,842, up 463% over the last 12 months but down from a high of $19,205 in December. In tech circles, it's common to hear that "bitcoin is a bubble, but blockchain is interesting."

From a technical perspective, it's true that blockchain has some attractive attributes. It also has some very real drawbacks. Both sides of this argument have been talked to death, and I have little to add to that dialog. I will say that many businesses would benefit from a thoughtful implementation of public key cryptography, that Merkle trees have attractive performance characteristics, and that proof-of-work is an abomination that must be replaced.

While the technical merits of blockchain are well trodden ground, I am intrigued by the emergence of crypto-anarchism as a social movement. In its most extreme form, this theory proclaims that technology&mdash;specifically blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and cryptography&mdash;can free us from the tyranny of corporations, governments, and the Illuminati. The crypto-anarchist is easily identified by his repeated pronouncements that "the code *is* the law" and "information wants to be free."  

This religious fervor for absolutely trustless systems is an exercise in navel gazing. Its most zealous adherents are building systems that are theoretically perfect and practically useless. We exist in the physical world, outside the bounds of the beautifully polished systems that they have created. It's all well and good that I have a token entitling me to a 1/1,000th ownership stake of a Monet, but when the current holder runs off and sells it in Macau I'm going to have to go to Interpol to try and get my cut.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Governments, laws, and civil society are necessary constructs. They will be altered by technology, but they will not be replaced by it.

I don't mean to say that blockchain is useless. On the contrary, I believe that blockchain creates value in two ways:

First, blockchain is driving standardization. This is not an inherent property, nor is it unique to blockchain&mdash;rather, it is a function of the hype that has been generated by it. You will never get a group of CEOs to adopt a common SQL schema based on Merkle trees, but they are more than happy to embrace the blockchain (and the subsequent pop in their share prices).

Second, the emergence of cryptocurrencies has created a massive economic incentive to study cryptography and decentralized systems. Until recently, these have been relatively niche specialties. Over the long run, increased interest and resources devoted to these fields could create substantial value for our society. It is my sincere hope that many of the technical drawbacks associated with blockchain can be overcome.
